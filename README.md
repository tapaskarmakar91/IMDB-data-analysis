Introduction:  
IMDb is the world's most popular and authoritative source for movie,TV and celebrity content.We have the data for the top-rated movies from the past decade along with various pieces of information about the movie, its actors, and the voters who have rated these movies online. In this analysis, we will try to find some interesting insights into these movies and their voters, using excel.

This Project involves the following steps :

-Task 1:

Reading the data:

Read the movies data file provided and store it in a Excel wordkbook(movies).

-Task 2:

Data Cleaning:

Now that we have loaded the dataset and inspected it, we see that most of the data is in place. As of now, no data cleaning is required, so let's start with some data 
manipulation, analysis, and visualisation to get various insights about the data.

-Task 3:
     	
Explotory data analysis(EDA)

-Task 4:
      
Data visualization by Dashboard & insights


Here is a possible conclusion for the IMDb data analysis:
